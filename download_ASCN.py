    Downloads DNA sequences from the NCBI database using ASN numbers provided in an input file and writes them to an output file.

    Args:
        input_file (str): Path to a file containing species names and ASN numbers, separated by a semicolon.
        output_file (str): Path to the output FASTA file where downloaded sequences will be saved.

    Each line in the input file should contain a species name followed by its ASN number, separated by a semicolon.
    The function modifies the sequence ID and description to use the species name and writes each sequence to the output file.
